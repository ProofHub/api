Attachments
====================

Uploading files to ProofHub is a two step process:

* Create the attachment, receive a token verifying the upload was successful.
* Attach the file to a topic, comment, task or file section. See the following endpoints for attaching:
	* [Create topic](https://github.com/sdplabs/proofhub-api/blob/master/sections/topics.md#create-topic)
	* [Create comment](https://github.com/sdplabs/proofhub-api/blob/master/sections/comments.md#create-comment)
	* [Create task](https://github.com/sdplabs/proofhub-api/blob/master/sections/tasks.md#create-task)
	* [Create file](https://github.com/sdplabs/proofhub-api/blob/master/sections/files.md#create-file)


Create attachments
----------------

* POST /attachments.json uploads a file. The request body should be the binary data of the attachment. Make sure to set the Content-Type and Content-Length headers. Here is an example:

`curl --data-binary @sample.png -H 'X-API-KEY: YOUR API KEY, Content-Type: image/png, User-Agent: AppName (name@example.com)' https://api.proofhub.com/v1/attachments.json`

Once the upload is successful, you'll get a 200 OK response, and we'll give you a token back that you'll need to save locally to attach the file.

```json
{
  "token": "UVBEbHZkc2puN3h3VHB2cDlZQ3JWdz09"
}
```
